  <p> Hi! My name is Ellie. I am currently a third-year undergrad student at Duke University studying Computer Science.
    To learn more about my past projects, check out my resume <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zeXlGHRR3roaPE14l0uINinVtjjqLwW_s_y7T4gmp5A/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>. In my free time, I also enjoy writing poetry, dancing to open-style and
    hip-hop, and playing Chopin's Ballade No. 1 on the piano. And of course, writing and experimenting with code. :) </p>
