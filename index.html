  <p> Hi! My name is Ellie. I am currently a fourth-year undergrad student at Duke University studying Computer Science.
    To learn more about my past projects, check out my resume <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/18Ih4wQz-HEuIdBqouvtKiyhkj3VUWBOcNrDxvXGl2Sc/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>. In my free time, I also enjoy writing poetry, dancing to open-style and
    hip-hop, watching films, and playing Chopin's Ballade No. 1 on the piano. And of course, writing and experimenting with code. :) </p>

  <h3> Research </h3>
  <ul>
    <li> Multi-Robot Motion Planning in Parallel and Weakly-Monotone Scenarios
      <ul>
        <li> <em> Over the summer of 2022, I was in the Duke research program CS+ and investigated a problem known as MRMP-RA. To solve this problem, we created various algorithms and heuristics, which we tested in our C++ codebase. </em> </li>
        <li> <em> To read more about my work in this, check out my summarizing paper about it <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kz7njd-7eyDF1uNiTuNdcZlnCp8-Skfe/view?usp=sharing">here</a>. </em> </li>
        <li> <em> This fall (2022), I will continue to investigate the MRMP problem with a special focus on the situation where parallel movement of the robots is allowed. </em> </li>
      </ul>
